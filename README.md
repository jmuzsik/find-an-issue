# Find an Issue

## Possibly, a better way to find github issues

Instructions are on the About section of the website. Basically, use a table to find issues from popular repositories to take on! Very simple :smile:

### [Website](https://findanissue.com)

Note: if it does not seem to work properly as in there are no new issues (0 days old) just click refresh. Site uses a service worker.

Hope you find an issue with the site!
